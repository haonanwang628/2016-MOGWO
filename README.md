# 2016-MOGWO-多目标灰狼优化算法 Maltab代码示例
The Multi-Objective Grey Wolf Optimizer (MOGWO) is an adaptation of the Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) for multi-objective optimization problems. To understand MOGWO, it's helpful to first know about the original GWO.

### Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO)

GWO is a heuristic optimization algorithm, introduced by Seyedali Mirjalili in 2014, inspired by the social hierarchy and hunting behavior of grey wolves. In GWO, the wolf pack is divided into four levels:

1. **Alpha (α)**: The leader, the strongest wolf in the pack.
2. **Beta (β)**: The second-in-command, subordinate only to the Alpha.
3. **Delta (δ)**: Lower-ranking wolves responsible for various activities.
4. **Omega (ω)**: The lowest-ranking wolves.

During the hunting (optimization) process, the rest of the wolves, including Betas and Deltas, follow the Alpha, while all the wolves adjust their positions to encircle the prey (optimal solution).

### Multi-Objective Grey Wolf Optimizer (MOGWO)

In multi-objective optimization problems, there are usually multiple objective functions to be optimized simultaneously, and these objectives can be conflicting. MOGWO extends GWO to effectively handle multiple optimization objectives. Key features and improvements in MOGWO include:

1. **Non-dominated Sorting**: A common technique in multi-objective optimization used to determine the dominance relations among solutions. In MOGWO, solutions in the population are categorized and evaluated based on non-dominated sorting.

2. **Diversity Maintenance**: To explore different regions of the solution space and maintain population diversity, MOGWO employs specific mechanisms, such as crowding distance calculations, to ensure a broad range of feasible solutions is found.

3. **Leader Selection**: In MOGWO, the leader (prey) for each iteration is selected from an archive of non-dominated solutions, ensuring that the solutions approach the optimal non-dominated front.

4. **Archive Update**: An external archive is used to store and update the best non-dominated solutions found so far.

Overall, MOGWO combines the social hierarchy and hunting behavior of grey wolves from GWO with common strategies in multi-objective optimization such as non-dominated sorting and diversity maintenance, offering an effective means to deal with complex optimization problems with multiple objective functions.
